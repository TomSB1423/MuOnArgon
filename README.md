# MuOnArgon
Simulate high energy muon interactions in a large Argon volume with Geant4.

Attempt to research results in G. Zhu, S.W. Li and J.F. Beacom, Phys. Rev. C99 (2019) 055810. 

Set up simplified DarkSide-20k geometry with main structures and liquid argon volumes and simulate Ion production from initial high-energy muons, using underground 
muon event generator. Production yields are the primary target. The simulation builds on the Geant4 framework, version 10.6.
